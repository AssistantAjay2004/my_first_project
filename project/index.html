            <p class="sectionSubTag">Education is the transmission of knowledge,
                skills, and character traits. There are many debates about its precise
                definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further
                issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the
                student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical
                thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These disagreements
                affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term can
                also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally,
                it can mean the academic field studying education.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag">There are many types of education. Formal education happens
                in a complex institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education
                is also structured but happens outside the formal schooling system. Informal
                education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and
                non-formal education are divided into levels. They include early childhood
                education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education.
                Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like teacher-centered
                and student-centered education. Forms of education can also be distinguished
                by subject, like science education, language education, and physical education.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag">Education socializes children into society by teaching
                cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become
                productive members of society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and
                raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions affect
                many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies.
                They determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must
                attend. International organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in
                promoting primary education for all children.</p>
